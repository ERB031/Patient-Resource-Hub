          <h2>Disability Determination for Adults</h2>

          <p>
            If you appear to meet all other requirements for SSI or SSDI, your disability will be
            evaluated using the following questions:
          </p>

          <h3>Sequential Evaluation for Adults:</h3>

          <ol>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Are you working?</strong></p>
              <p>
                If you are performing Substantial Gainful Activity (earning over $1,310/month⁍),
                you are not eligible for SSI. If you are not performing SGA, SSA will send your
                case to the Disability Determination Service (DDS) for the next step.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Do you have a severe impairment?</strong></p>
              <p>
                In order to be considered "severe", your condition must significantly limit your
                ability to do basic work-related activities (such as lifting, standing, walking,
                sitting, or remembering) for at least 12 months. If it does, your case will move on
                to the next step.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <strong
                  >Does your impairment meet or medically equal a listing in SSA's "Listing of
                  Impairments"?</strong
                >
              </p>
              <p>
                DDS determines if your impairment(s) “meets” one of the listings by comparing it to
                the specific requirements in the listings. (It is not enough to have a diagnosis
                that is named in the listings, it must also match the severity.) If your
                impairment(s) meets or medically equals the requirements of a listing, and meets the
                12-month duration requirement, you will be considered disabled and approved for
                benefits.
              </p>
              <p>
                If your impairment(s) is severe, but does not meet or medically equal a specific
                listing, DDS determines the most you are physically and mentally able to do, despite
                the limitations resulting from your impairments using a "Residual Functional
                Capacity" (RFC) assessment. Depending on this result, your case will move on to the
                next step.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Are you able to do your past work?</strong></p>
              <p>
                Next, DDS considers whether you are physically and mentally able to do any job that
                you did in the past according to your RFC. SSA does not consider whether you can get
                a particular job, but whether you can do a particular job. If you cannot do your
                past work, your claim moves on to the next step.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Can you do any other kind of work?</strong></p>
              <p>
                Finally, DDS will consider your RFC limitations, vocational factors such as age,
                education and work experience, and work existing in the national economy. If you
                cannot perform other work that exists in significant numbers in the national
                economy, you will be considered disabled.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            ⁍the monthly earnings limit for people who are blind is generally higher than the limit
            that applies to non-blind disabled workers. In 2021, the monthly earnings limit for
            people who are blind is $2,190.
