          <h1>Save for disability goals without losing essential benefits.</h1>
          <p>
            An ABLE Account is a tax-advantaged savings account that allows
            individuals with disabilities to build savings without affecting
            their eligibility for SSI, Medicaid, and other means-tested programs
            (FAFSA, HUD, SNAP, etc.). Investment income grows tax-free, and
            anyone can contribute—including friends, caregivers, and family.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first $100,000 in an ABLE account do not count toward SSI’s
            resource limit. If your balance climbs higher, SSI payments pause,
            but Medicaid continues; once the balance falls below $100,000, SSI
            restarts without a new application.

                You can open an account in any state program as long as you meet

                If your disability began before age 26, but SSA recorded an onset
                date after age 26 for SSI or SSDI, you can still pursue an ABLE
                account with a physician certification confirming when your
                disability actually began and that it meets SSA’s definition of
                significant functional limitations. <em>SSA staff are not
                responsible for determining ABLE onset dates.</em>
              </p>
              <p>
                Congress is considering legislation to raise the age-of-onset
                cutoff to 46.
