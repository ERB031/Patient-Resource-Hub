          <h2>Disability Determination for Children</h2>

          <p>
            If a child appears to meet all other requirements for SSI or SSDI, their disability will
            be evaluated using the following questions:
          </p>

          <h3>Is the child working?</h3>
          <p>
            If a child is working and performing Substantial Gainful Activity (earning over
            $1,310/month), SSA cannot consider the child disabled, and the sequential evaluation
            process ends here. If the child is not working, their case will be sent to the
            <a
              href="https://www.ssa.gov/disability/determination.htm"
              target="_blank"
              rel="noreferrer noopener"
              >Disability Determination Service (DDS)</a
            >
            for the next step.
          </p>

          <h3>Does the child have a severe impairment?</h3>
          <p>
            If the child is not performing SGA, the Disability Determination Service (DDS) will
            determine if the child has a medically determinable physical or mental impairment (or
            combination of impairments) established by objective medical evidence and whether it is
            severe. An impairment(s) is not severe if it is only a slight abnormality or a
            combination of slight abnormalities that causes no more than minimal functional
            limitations. If the child has a severe medically determinable impairment(s), their case
            will move on to the next step.
          </p>

          <p>
            DDS will determine if a child's impairment(s) "meets" one of the listings by comparing
            it to the specific requirements in the listings. (It is not enough to have a diagnosis
            that is named in the listings, it must also match the severity.) If the impairment(s)
            meets or medically equals the requirements of a listing, and meets the 12-month duration
            requirement, they will be considered disabled and approved for benefits.
          </p>

          <p>
            If their impairment(s) is severe, but does not meet or medically equal a specific
            listing, DDS determines whether the impairment "functionally equals" the listings by
            evaluating the effects of the impairment(s) on the child's ability to function at home,
            at school, and in the community. DDS considers how the child's functionings affect six
            domains:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>acquiring &amp; using information</li>
            <li>attending &amp; completing tasks</li>
            <li>interacting with others</li>
            <li>moving about and manipulating objects</li>
            <li>caring for themselves</li>
            <li>health and physical wellbeing</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            If a child's impairment(s) results in "marked" limitations in at least two of these
            domains of functioning, or an "extreme" limitation in at least one domain, then his or
            her impairment(s) functionally equals the listings.
