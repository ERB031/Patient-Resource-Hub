they do not change how ssa treats earned income. wages continue to affect benefits the same way, even if you move that income into an able account. the able to work provision lets employed account holders exceed the $15,000 annual contribution limit. you can deposit an additional $12,760 1 (or your gross income for the year, whichever is lower). 1 the extra allowance is $15,950 in alaska and $14,680 in hawaii. the fafsa application excludes able balances from the assets it counts. you can roll over money from a 529 college savings plan into an able account without taxes or penalties as long as both accounts are held by you (or a qualified family member) and the rollover stays within the annual able contribution limit. state programs tap a state flag to see enrollment status, fees, contribution limits, and whether out-of-state residents can participate. data mirrors the patient resource hub notion database linked above. you have a disability with onset prior to your 26th birthday 1. you meet the severity of disability requirement by: receiving ssi or ssdi. having your doctor complete a disability certification affirming “marked and severe” functional limitations that are expected to last at least 12 months or result in death 2. receiving ssi or ssdi. having your doctor complete a disability certification affirming “marked and severe” functional limitations that are expected to last at least 12 months or result in death 2. combined deposits from all contributors (you, family, friends, etc.) are capped at $15,000 per tax year. lifetime caps depend on the state program and currently range from $235,000 to $589,000. able accounts deep dive state programs",
