          <h2>What is Medicare?</h2>
          <p>Medicare is the federal health insurance program for people who are 65 or older, certain younger people with disabilities, and people with End-Stage Renal Disease (permanent kidney failure requiring dialysis or a transplant, sometimes called ESRD).</p>

          <h3>The different parts of Medicare</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Medicare Part A (Hospital Insurance)</strong>: Part A covers inpatient hospital stays, care in a skilled nursing facility, hospice care, and some home health care.</li>
            <li><strong>Medicare Part B (Medical Insurance)</strong>: Part B covers certain doctors' services, outpatient care, medical supplies, and preventive services.</li>
            <li><strong>Medicare Part C (Medicare Advantage)</strong>: An “all in one” alternative to Original Medicare. These bundled plans include Part A, Part B, and usually Part D. Most plans offer extra benefits that Original Medicare doesn’t cover — like vision, hearing, and dental services.</li>
            <li><strong>Medicare Part D (prescription drug coverage)</strong>: Part D adds prescription drug coverage to Original Medicare, some Medicare Cost Plans, some Medicare Private-Fee-for-Service Plans, and Medicare Medical Savings Account Plans.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Who is eligible for Medicare?</h3>
          <p>Generally, you're eligible for Medicare if you're a U.S. citizen or have been a legal resident for at least 5 years and:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>You are age 65 or older.</li>
            <li>You are under 65 but have been entitled to Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) for 24 months.</li>
            <li>You have End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD).</li>
            <li>You have Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig's disease.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>How to Enroll</h3>
          <p>If you're already getting benefits from Social Security or the Railroad Retirement Board (RRB), you'll automatically be enrolled in Part A and Part B starting the first day of the month you turn 65. If you're under 65 and disabled, you'll automatically get Part A and Part B after you get disability benefits from Social Security for 24 months.</p>
          <p>If you need to sign up, you can do so during your Initial Enrollment Period, which usually starts 3 months before your 65th birthday and ends 3 months after.</p>
          <p>For more detailed information, visit the official <a href="https://www.medicare.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Medicare.gov</a> website or call 1-800-MEDICARE.</p>

          <h3>Help with Medicare Costs</h3>
          <p>If you have limited income and resources, you may qualify for help paying your Medicare premiums and other costs. These programs include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Medicare Savings Programs</strong>: State programs that help pay premiums, deductibles, and coinsurance.</li>
            <li><strong>Extra Help</strong>: A program to help pay for Medicare prescription drug coverage (Part D) costs.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>You can learn more and apply through your state's Medicaid office or the Social Security Administration.</p>
