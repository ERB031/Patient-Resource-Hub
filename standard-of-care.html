          <p>
            Not every community has the same access, safety, or trust inside the healthcare system. This guide pairs lived-experience explainers with action-oriented resources so you can quickly understand which forces are shaping care and how to advocate for something better.

          <h2>Why the standard of care leaves people behind</h2>
          <p>
            In a perfect world, “standard of care” would mean that everyone gets evidence-based treatment, respectful communication, and the right follow-up. But the true standard shifts depending on income, disability, race, gender identity, immigration status, geography, and whether the system was built with you in mind.
          </p>
          <p>
            Use this page to see how social determinants of health shape clinical decisions—and to find language you can bring into appointments, appeals, and community organizing.
          </p>

            <li>Skim each primer to understand what the care gap looks like and how patients are protecting themselves.</li>

          <h3>A note about intersectionality</h3>
          <p>
            Each patient's experience is unique and usually shaped by multiple determinants at once. This list is a starting point—not an exhaustive map of every community's reality.
