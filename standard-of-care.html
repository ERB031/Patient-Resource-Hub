          <p>
            Not every community has the same access, safety, or trust inside the healthcare system. This guide pairs lived-experience explainers with action-oriented resources so you can quickly understand which forces are shaping care and how to advocate for something better.

          <h2>Why the standard of care leaves people behind</h2>
          <p>
            In a perfect world, “standard of care” would mean that everyone gets evidence-based treatment, respectful communication, and the right follow-up. But the true standard shifts depending on income, disability, race, gender identity, immigration status, geography, and whether the system was built with you in mind.

          <p>
            Use this page to see how social determinants of health shape clinical decisions—and to find language you can bring into appointments, appeals, and community organizing.
