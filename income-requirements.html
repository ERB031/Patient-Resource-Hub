          <h2>How SSA defines income</h2>
          <p>
            SSA considers any item you receive in cash or in kind that can be used to meet your
            need for food or shelter to be "income."
          </p>

          <h3>Types of income SSA reviews</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Earned income.</strong>
              Includes wages, net earnings (income minus expenses) from self-employment, certain
              royalties, honoraria, and sheltered workshop payments.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>In-kind income.</strong>
              Includes food or shelter that you get for free or for less than its fair market
              value.<sup>1</sup>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Unearned income.</strong>
              Includes Social Security benefits, pensions, state disability payments,
              unemployment benefits, interest income, dividends, and cash from friends and
              relatives.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Deemed income.<sup>2</sup></strong>
              SSA may count part of the income of a spouse or parent you live with when deciding
              whether you qualify for SSI.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Generally, the more countable income you have, the less SSI benefits you will receive.
            If your countable income exceeds the allowable limit, you cannot receive SSI.
          </p>
          <p>
            To determine how your income affects your payment, SSA subtracts any income that does
            not count (see the list below) from your total income. The remaining amount is your
            "countable income," which is deducted from the SSI federal benefit rate to get your
            monthly SSI benefit.

              See example calculations from SSA.
            </a>
          </p>
          <p>
            SSDI is only affected by your earned income. If you perform work that is over the
            substantial gainful activity (SGA) limit, you are not eligible for benefits unless you
            are in a

          </p>

          <h3>Income that does not count when calculating SSI benefits</h3>
          <p>SSA excludes several income sources when figuring your payment, including:</p>

          <div class="definition-grid">
            <ul>
              <li>Your first $20 of income per month.</li>

                Your first $65 of earnings per month and one-half of any additional earnings over
                $65.
