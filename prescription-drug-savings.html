          <h2>Prescription Drug Savings</h2>

          <p>Many pharmaceutical companies, state programs, nonprofits, and other organizations offer support through various drug assistance programs that offer free or reduced-cost medications for those that do not have insurance, are underinsured, and otherwise can’t afford their medication and meet certain criteria.</p>

          <h3>Types of Prescription Drug Assistance:</h3>

          <p>To find out who to call about your eligibility for these programs, use <a href="https://www.medicare.gov/talk-to-someone" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this website</a>.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Patient Assistance Programs (PAPs) Overview</strong>
              <p>PAPs provide financial assistance to low-income individuals to increase any existing prescription drug coverage who meet certain criteria. These programs typically come from <em>drug manufacturers</em>, <em>nonprofit groups and corporations,</em> or <em>state governments</em>. These are charitable in nature and directly benefit the patient rather than their insurance plan. PAPs typically require an application process and require the patient to fit certain criteria outlined by each program in order to qualify.</p>
              <p>Each particular program will have its own criteria, but some typical criteria could look something like:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Proving your W-2 that shows the patient is a certain percentage below the federal poverty level</li>
                <li>Not having health insurance or an applicable drug benefit from their current health plan such as those eligible for Medicare</li>
                <li>The patient' prescribing physician completing part of the application providing evidence of the need for the drug</li>
              </ul>
              <p><em>Note</em> for those enrolled in <strong>Medicare:</strong> PAPs may be used by those enrolled in Medicare, <em>but</em> they must operate “outside the Part D benefit.” This means that the drug associated with the PAP is not counted as an incurred cost under Part D and would not be applied to the beneficiary’s true out-of-pocket (TrOOP).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Pharmaceutical Drug manufacturer PAPs</strong>
              <p>Some pharmaceutical companies offer programs to help pay for prescriptions for people in a Medicare Drug Plan (Part D). The majority of the PAPs through drug manufacturers are for specific name-brand medications. Each drug manufacturer will have its own criteria for its assistance programs and will require paperwork to determine eligibility and enrollment. Both your physician or pharmacist may be able to offer information regarding PAPs you may qualify for. Find out if there is a pharmaceutical assistance program for a drug that you take by entering the drug name into this <a href="https://www.medicare.gov/plan-compare/#/pharmaceutical-assistance-program?lang=en&year=2021" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Medicare database link</a></p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>State/Governmental PAPs</strong>
              <p>Some states offer a state pharmaceutical assistance program (SPAP) to help their residents pay for prescription drugs. These programs will look very different from state to state but certain states offer programs that support those who have certain illnesses by paying for their prescription drugs. For example, many states offer HIV/AIDS drug assistance programs as well as programs for people who have End-Stage Renal Disease.</p>
              <p>Find out if your state offers a Pharmaceutical Assistance Program and more information about that program through this <a href="https://www.medicare.gov/plan-compare/#/pharmaceutical-assistance-program/states?lang=en&year=2021" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Medicare database link</a></p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Drug Discount Cards</strong>
              <p>These can easily be found online and are sometimes provided to patients by their doctors. Unlike PAPs, these do not require any sort of application process. Instead, some basic information may be collected by the manufacturer, and coupons generally are available without the need to meet certain criteria.<br><strong>Regarding Medicare and Medicaid</strong>: Coupons generally are allowed to be used with commercial health plans, but some states have moved to ban or reduce their usage. Coupons are banned from use on drugs purchased with federal health care insurance, including Medicare and Medicaid. In some cases, drug discount cards can still be used by those enrolled in Medicare if they operate “outside the Part D benefit.” This means that the drug associated with the PAP is not counted as an incurred cost under Part D and would not be applied to the beneficiary’s true out-of-pocket (TrOOP).</p>
              <p>You are not required to use a Medicare drug plan and instead, you can purchase medications without using any drug coverage if you find that your pharmacy provides low discounted prices or lower everyday prices. Make sure to read the fine print, but you may also be able to use discount coupons at some pharmacies</p>
              <p><em>Because of various strict policies that continue to evolve, it's vital <strong>to read the discount card's "fine print" as well as talk to your pharmacist in regards to using drug discount cards in an appropriate way.</strong></em></p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Does a Drug Discount Card work together with a Medicare/Medicare plan that includes drug coverage?</strong>
                  <p>No. You cannot apply a drug discount card on top of your Medicare or Medicaid drug coverage. You can use the card <em>instead</em> of using your Medicare plan prescription drug coverage, but not together. If your Medicare plan does not include any prescription drug coverage, then you can use the discount card outside of your Medicare plan coverage. If you are covered under Medicaid you generally cannot use drug discount cards.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>What happens when your Medicare plan's drug co-pay is more than your pharmacy's everyday retail cost?</strong>
                  <p>You would pay the lower retail cost, not the co-pay. If you are using one of your Part D plan’s network pharmacies and the pharmacy’s everyday retail price is lower than your plan’s cost-sharing (or co-payment), you will only pay the lower retail cost and not your plan's cost-sharing. So using your Medicare Part D drug plan will have no effect on your prescription cost when the pharmacy's everyday price of a drug is lower than your co-pay. For example, if you purchase medication and your drug plan has a $40 co-pay, but the pharmacy has an everyday price of $35 for the same drug, then you will pay the lower retail price ($35) and not your plan's $40 co-pay</p>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>Other Considerations</strong>: <br>Coupons nearly always have some kind of <em>limit</em>, and therefore if the medication is one that you may be on long-term, this may be a temporary solution to afford that said medication. Some coupons allow multiple uses, but very few offer savings for more than a year.</p>
              <p>After the coupon limit has been reached, as the consumer you will need to reevaluate the situation and have a conversation with your care team including your pharmacist and provider about what is next.<br>Some other options could include continuing to purchase the drug without the savings the coupon provided if you are able or even seeking a different treatment.</p>
              <p>If you were paying out of pocket and using coupons or discount cards because the coverage of said medication was denied by insurance, this would be a good time to speak to your physician and/or pharmacist about potentially re-applying for insurance approval of the drug with new information about your success with the medication.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Hospital Uncompensated Care Programs (Charity Care Assistance)</strong>
              <p>Uncompensated care is an overall measure of hospital care provided for which no payment was received from the patient or insurer. Financial assistance includes lowering the cost or even making care completely free for patients who qualify. This can include both care they never expected to be reimbursed for, or at a reduced cost for those that qualify by each hospitals' set criteria and have applied for financial assistance. Uncompensated care is used by patients who have incurred medical costs in an unplanned fashion, as well as in a planned fashion for patients in need of non-emergency medical treatments or tests that would be out of pocket whether that means they have no health insurance or otherwise would be an out of pocket expense.</p>
              <p>If you are unable to pay your bill contact the financial assistance department of the hospital you were treated at so that they can help you know your options and get the resources you need.</p>
