          <h1>Medicaid</h1>
          <p>
            Medicaid provides free or low-cost health coverage to millions of Americans,
            including some low-income people, families and children, pregnant women, the
            elderly, and people with disabilities.
          </p>
          <p>
            States administer their own Medicaid programs according to federal
            requirements, meaning that eligibility, costs, and coverage vary between
            states. For General information about Medicaid, see the links below:
          </p>
          <div class="medicaid-accordion">
            <button class="accordion-button" data-section="eligibility">
              <span>Eligibility</span>
              <span class="accordion-icon">+</span>
            </button>
            <div class="accordion-content" id="eligibility">
              <div class="accordion-inner">
                <p>Medicaid eligibility varies by state. Whether you qualify for coverage depends partly on whether your state has expanded its program to cover all people with household incomes below a certain level.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>In all states, you can qualify for Medicaid based on income, household size, disability, family status, etc. Some people qualify for an individual insurance plan with savings based on income from the healthcare.gov marketplace instead. <a href="https://www.healthcare.gov/lower-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Use this website to determine if you qualify for Medicaid based on income alone.</a></li>
                  <li>If your state hasn't expanded Medicaid, your income is below the federal poverty level, and you don't qualify for Medicaid under your state's current rules, you won't qualify for Medicaid coverage or savings on a private health plan bought through the Marketplace - but you should still fill out a Marketplace application to see if your state has coverage options that could work for you – particularly if you have children, are pregnant, or have a disability.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Medicaid beneficiaries must be US citizens (or certain qualified non-citizens, such as lawful permanent residents) and living in the state in which they are receiving Medicaid. Some eligibility groups are also limited by age, or by pregnancy or parenting status.</p>
                <p>States have the option to establish a "medically needy program" for individuals with significant health needs whose income is too high to otherwise qualify for Medicaid.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Medically needy individuals can still become eligible by "spending down" the amount of income that is above a state's medically needy income standard by incurring expenses for medical/remedial care for which they do not have health insurance. Once their incurred expenses exceed the difference between the individual's income and the state's medically needy income level (the "spenddown" amount), the person can be eligible for Medicaid.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Once a person is deemed eligible, their coverage is effective either on the date of application or the first day of the month of application. Benefits also may be covered retroactively for up to three months prior to the month of application, if the individual would have been eligible during that period had he or she applied.</p>
                <p>Coverage generally stops at the end of the month in which a person no longer meets the requirements for eligibility.</p>

                <p>You can apply for Medicaid any time of year (Medicaid does not have Open Enrollment Periods) by doing one of the following:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Fill out an application through the Health Insurance Marketplace. If it looks like anyone in your household qualifies for Medicaid, they will send your information to your state agency. <a href="https://www.healthcare.gov/have-coverage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marketplace</a> can also tell you if you qualify for an individual insurance plan with savings based on your income instead.</li>
                  <li>Apply directly to your state Medicaid agency. If you apply for Medicaid coverage to your state agency, you'll also find out if your children qualify for <a href="https://www.insurekidsnow.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CHIP</a>. If they qualify, you won't have to buy an insurance plan to cover them.</li>

              <div class="accordion-inner">
                <h3>Premiums</h3>
                <p>States have the option to charge premiums and out of pocket spending (cost sharing) requirements for Medicaid enrollees, including copayments, coinsurance, deductibles, and other similar charges. Certain vulnerable groups, such as children and pregnant women, are exempt from most out of pocket costs and copayments and coinsurance cannot be charged for certain services.</p>
                <p>States can charge limited premiums and enrollment fees on:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Pregnant women and infants with family income at or above 150% FPL</li>
                  <li>Qualified disabled and working individuals with income above 150% FPL</li>
                  <li>Disabled working individuals eligible under the Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999 (TWWIIA)</li>
                  <li>Disabled children eligible under the Family Opportunity Act (FOA)</li>
                  <li>Medically needy individuals</li>
                </ul>
                <p>States have the option to impose higher, alternative premiums on other groups of enrollees whose family incomes exceed 150% of the federal poverty level. Certain groups, such as institutionalized individuals and most children, are excluded from higher cost sharing.</p>

                <h3>Prescription Drugs</h3>
                <p>To encourage the use of lower-cost drugs, states may establish different copayments for generic versus brand-name drugs or for drugs included on a preferred drug list. For people with incomes above 150% FPL, copayments for "non-preferred" drugs may be as high as 20%. For people with income at or below 150% FPL, copayments are limited to nominal amounts. States also have the option to establish different copayments for mail order drugs and for drugs sold in a pharmacy.</p>

                <h3>Non-Emergency Use of Emergency Rooms</h3>
                <p>States may impose higher copayments when people visit a hospital emergency department for non-emergency services. For people with incomes above 150% FPL, copayments may up to the state's cost for the service under certain conditions:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>The hospital determined, after an appropriate medical screening, that the individual does not need emergency medical services.</li>
                  <li>An alternative non-emergency services provider is available and accessible in a timely manner to provide the services needed by the individual with no or a lesser copayment.</li>
                  <li>The hospital has provided the individual with
                    <ol type="a">
                      <li>notice that a copayment may be required before the service is provided</li>
                      <li>the name and location of an alternative non-emergency services provider</li>
                      <li>a referral to this provider</li>
                    </ol>
                  </li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Out of Pocket Costs</h3>
                <p>States can impose copayments, coinsurance, deductibles, and other similar charges on most Medicaid-covered benefits based on the individual state's payment for that service. Cost sharing for most services is limited to nominal or minimal amounts. Out of pocket costs cannot be imposed for emergency services, family planning services, pregnancy-related services, or preventive services for children.</p>
                <p>Generally, out of pocket costs apply to all Medicaid enrollees except those specifically exempted by law and most are limited to nominal amounts. (Exempted groups include children, terminally ill individuals, and individuals residing in an institution.)</p>
                <p>States have the option to establish alternative out of pocket costs for certain groups of Medicaid enrollees with income above 100% of the federal poverty level. Alternative out of pocket costs may be higher than nominal charges but cannot exceed 5 percent of family income.</p>
                <p>Because Medicaid covers particularly low-income and often very sick patients, services cannot be withheld for failure to pay, but enrollees may be held liable for unpaid copayments.</p>
