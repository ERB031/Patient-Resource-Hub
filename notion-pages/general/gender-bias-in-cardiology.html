<h3>History/Timeline of Women’s Heart Disease Research</h3>
<p>early 19th/20th centuries: heart linked to emotion, doctors <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/10/heart-disease-women/412495/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">believed</a> that the people most prone to heart attacks were ambitious, successful, male - may have angry temperament to trigger </p>
<p>1950s: heart disease finally linked to diet, exercise, physical factors vs. emotional causes but remained a “man’s condition&quot; (based on <a href="https://www.sevencountriesstudy.com/about-the-study/history/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ancel Keys’ research</a> on mainly middle aged men)</p>
<p>1982: <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7050440" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial</a> (established link between cholesterol/heart disease) involved 12,866 men, 0 women</p>
<p>1984: more women die of heart attacks than men (previously, more men had died - but the gap narrowed as <a href="https://time.com/5499872/women-heart-disease/#:~:text=Historically%2C%20research%20and%20innovation%20in%20heart%20disease%20was%20for%20men%20and%20by%20men%2C%20and%20women%20were%20left%20by%20the%20wayside%20to%20die%2C%E2%80%9D%20says%20Dr.%20Noel%20Bairey%20Merz%2C%20director%20of%20the%20Barbra%20Streisand%20Women%E2%80%99s%20Heart%20Center%20in%20the%20Smidt%20Heart%20Institute%20at%20Cedars%2DSinai%20in%20Los%20Angeles" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">innovations/research saved more men’s lives</a>)</p>
<p>1980s-1990s: research didn’t specifically exclude women, but often had requirements that made the sample group overwhelmingly male (ex: excluding women of reproductive age, etc.)</p>
<p>1991: <a href="https://www.whi.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Women’s Health Initiative</a> began, Bernadine Healy (cardiologist) became the first woman to head NIH, quoted saying: <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJM199107253250408" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“Heart disease is also a woman’s disease, not just a man’s disease in disguise.”</a></p>
<p>1995: <a href="http://phs.bwh.harvard.edu/phs1.htm#recruit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Physicians’ Health Study</a> (discovered that aspirin to reduced the risk of heart attack) involved 22,071 men, 0 women</p>
<p>2003: American Heart Association’s <a href="https://www.goredforwomen.org/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Go Red for Women</a> founded</p>
<p>2015: <em><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/2101/text" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Research for All Act </a></em>requires NIH–funded research to use both male/female animals, cells, people</p>
