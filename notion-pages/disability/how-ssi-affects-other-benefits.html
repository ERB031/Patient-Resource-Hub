          <p><strong>Medicaid:</strong></p>
<p>In most States, if you are an SSI recipient, you may be automatically eligible for <a href="https://www.medicaid.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Medicaid</a> (and an SSI application is also an application for Medicaid). In states where you must apply for and establish your eligibility for Medicaid with another agency, SSA will direct you to the office where you can apply for Medicaid.</p>
<hr class="notion-divider" />
<p><strong>Medicare:</strong></p>
<p>States pay the Medicare premiums for people who receive SSI benefits. If you get SSI and have Medicare, you will also be eligible for <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/benefits/medicare/prescriptionhelp.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Extra Help with Medicare Prescription Drug Coverage</a> without filing a separate application.</p>
<p>You may also be eligible for other state <a href="/4885bca28c1c41c4b4665e69c4d680c9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Medicare Savings Programs</a>:</p>
<p>The <strong>Qualified Medical Beneficiary (QMB) Program</strong> pays Medicare Part A and/or Part B premiums for low-income Medicare recepients. Medicare providers are not allowed to bill you for Medicare deductibles, coinsurance, and copayments.</p>
<p>The<strong> Specified Low-Income Medicare Beneficiary (SLMB) Programs</strong> and <strong>Qualifying Individual (QI-1) Programs </strong>pay Medicare Part B premiums only for people whose resources fall under a limit determined by the state.</p>
<p>The <strong>Qualified Disabled and Working Individuals (QDWI) Program</strong> pays Medicare Part A premiums only for people who are under age 65, disabled, but no longer entitled to free Medicare Hospital Insurance Part A because they successfully returned to work.</p>
<p>These programs vary by state.</p>
<hr class="notion-divider" />
<p><strong>SNAP (Food Stamps):</strong></p>
<p>SSI benefits count in computing <a href="https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/supplemental-nutrition-assistance-program" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) </a>eligibility. If you are applying for/receiving SSI, your Social Security office may provide you with SNAP information and an application form. In some States, the SSI application is also an application for SNAP if the individual lives alone.</p>
<hr class="notion-divider" />
<p><strong>State &amp; Local Need-Based Assistance:</strong></p>
<p>Some States offer need-based assistance to aged, blind, and disabled people through their welfare department. The state may require you to apply for SSI if you receive these benefits. If you are approved for SSI, your state or local public assistance payments will usually stop. Your state may be entitled to collect part of your retroactive SSI benefits as repayment for the money they paid you while your claim was being processed.</p>
