          <p>When you start receiving SSDI benefits, certain members of your family may qualify for a monthly benefit of up to 50 percent of your disability benefit amount based on your work:</p>
<ul><li>current or former spouse(s)</li><li>children under 18</li><li>adult child who became disabled before age 22</li></ul>
<hr class="notion-divider" />
<p><strong>Spousal Benefits:</strong></p>
<p>Benefits are payable to your spouse if they are 62 or older (unless your they collect a higher Social Security benefit based on their earnings record) or if they are caring for your child<strong> </strong>under age 16 (or an adult child who was disabled before age 22 and is entitled to benefits). </p>
<p>If your spouse is eligible for retirement benefits on their own record, SSA will pay that amount first. But, if the spouse’s benefit from your record is a higher amount, they will get a combination of the two benefits that equals the higher amount. </p>
<p>Your divorced spouse may qualify for benefits on your record, even if you have remarried, if:</p>
<ul><li>you were married at least 10 years.</li><li>they are at least 62 years old</li><li>they are unmarried</li><li>they are not be eligible for an equal or higher benefit on another Social Security record</li></ul>
<p>The amount of benefits payable to your divorced spouse has no effect on the amount of benefits you or your current spouse may receive.</p>
<p>If your spouse or ex-spouse will also receive a <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/benefits/retirement/planner/wep.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pension based on work not covered</a> by Social Security, such as government or foreign work, their Social Security <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/benefits/retirement/planner/gpo-calc.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">benefit on your record</a> may be affected.</p>
<hr class="notion-divider" />
<p><strong>Child Benefits:</strong></p>
<p>Your biological child, adopted child, stepchild, or dependent grandchild may also qualify to receive benefits on your record if they are unmarried and either:</p>
<ul><li>under age 18</li><li>age 18-19 and a full time grade school student (grades K-12)<span class="notion-equation" data-equation="^1">⁍</span></li><li>over age 18 and disabled from a disability that started before age 22</li></ul>
<p></p>
<p><span class="notion-equation" data-equation="^1">⁍</span>if the child is still a full-time student at a secondary (or elementary) school at age 18, benefits will continue until the child graduates or until two months after the child becomes age 19 (whichever is first)</p>
<hr class="notion-divider" />
<p><strong>Disabled Adult Child:</strong></p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/benefits/disability/qualify.html#anchor7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">disabled &quot;adult child&quot;</a> who is unmarried, age 18 or older, and has a disability that meets the definition of disability for adults and started before age 22 may be eligible for benefits if a parent is deceased or starts receiving retirement or disability benefits. It is not necessary that the child ever worked because benefits are paid based on the parent&#39;s earnings record.</p>
<p>If the adult child is already receiving benefits on their own record, they should check to see if higher benefits may be payable on a parent&#39;s earnings record or if they are entitled to Medicare.</p>
<p>These benefits will generally end if the child gets married. However, some marriages (for example, to another disabled &quot;adult child&quot;) are considered protected.</p>
<p>To apply for family benefits, disabled adult children should use form <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/forms/ssa-3368-bk.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SSA-368-BK</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Survivor Benefits:</strong></p>
<p>Your family may also be eligible to receive Social Security benefits after you die. Find more information about <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/benefits/survivors/ifyou.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">survivor benefits here.</a></p>
