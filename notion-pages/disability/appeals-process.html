          <p>Each time the Social Security Administration (SSA) makes a decision about your case, it is called an &quot;initial determination.&quot; You can appeal initial determinations about:</p>
<ul><li>your eligibility for benefits</li><li>your benefit payment amount </li><li>whether or not you have to repay an overpayment</li><li>the result of an appeal</li></ul>
<p>You can <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/myaccount/application-status.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">check the status of your appeal online. </a></p>
<h4> <strong>Steps of the Appeal Process:</strong></h4>
<p><em>You must submit an appeal within 60 days of receiving written notice about a decision (SSA considers the time you receive a notice to be 5 days after the date on the notice).</em></p>

Tell the judge as soon as possible if you need money for reasonable and necessary travel costs.</li><li>The judge may want you to undergo additional medical exams or tests. If this is the case, SSA will pay for and schedule the appointments for you.</li><li>The judge may ask other witnesses (such as medical and vocational experts) to testify at your hearing.
