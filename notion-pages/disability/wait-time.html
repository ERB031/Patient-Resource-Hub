          <p>The waiting period depends on the severity of your disability. The average person receives a decision 3-5 months after they apply for SSI or SSDI. For SSDI, your payments can’t begin until you’ve been disabled for at least five full months.<span class="notion-equation" data-equation="^1">⁍</span> Factors that influence claim speed include:</p>
<ul><li>how quickly SSA obtains medical evidence from a medical source</li><li>whether a medical examination is necessary</li><li>if the claim is randomly selected for quality assurance review </li></ul>
<p></p>
<p><em>If your disability is severe, you may qualify for an expedited application process and/or interim benefits using one of the following: </em></p>
<p><strong>Quick Disability Determinations:</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/disabilityresearch/qdd.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Quick Disability Determinations (QDD)</a> program uses a computer-based predictive model to screen initial applications and identify cases where a favorable disability determination is highly likely and medical evidence is readily available. </p>
<p><strong>Compassionate Allowances:</strong></p>
<p>Certain conditions qualify for <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/compassionateallowances/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">compassionate allowances</a>, which expedite the process for people with the most severe disability. You can find the list of compassionate allowance conditions <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/compassionateallowances/conditions.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Presumptive Disability Benefits &amp; Emergency Advance Payments:</strong></p>
<p>In some cases, SSA can provide <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/ssi/text-expedite-ussi.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">presumptive disability benefits</a> for up to 6 months while you are waiting for a final decision from <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/ssi/text-disable-ussi.htm#decide" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DDS</a>. A list of conditions that qualify for expedited payments is available <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/ssi/text-expedite-ussi.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>. If you turn out not to be eligible, you do not need to repay these payments. </p>
<p>Under certain circumstances, SSA can provide an <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/ssi/text-expedite-ussi.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">emergency advance payment</a> to new applicants who face a financial emergency and who are due SSI benefits that are delayed or not received. You can only receive one emergency advance payment and its value will be subtracted from your future payments. </p>
<p><strong>Wounded Warriors Program:</strong></p>
<p>If a military member or veteran sustained an illness, injury, or wound while on active duty status on or after October 1, 2001, they will receive expedited processing of their disability claim, regardless of how or where the disability occurred. For more information, see the <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/people/veterans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wounded warriors program</a>.</p>
