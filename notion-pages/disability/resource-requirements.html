<p>SSI has limits to how many resources you can own while receiving benefits. If the value of your resources that SSA counts is over the allowable limit ($2,000 for an individual or $3,000 for a couple for SSI) at the beginning of the month, you cannot receive SSI for that month. If you decide to sell the excess resources for what they are worth, you may receive SSI beginning the month after you sell the excess resources. </p>
<p>SSDI is <strong>not</strong> impacted by resources. </p>

<p></p>
<p>If you, your spouse, or a co–owner give away a resource or sell it for <strong>less</strong> than it is worth, you may be ineligible for certain benefits for up to 36 months. How long you are ineligible benefits depends on the value of the resource you transferred.</p>
<p>If you sell a resource for what it is worth, the 36–month ineligibility period does not apply. But, the money you receive from the sale may make you ineligible if it puts you over the resource limit.
