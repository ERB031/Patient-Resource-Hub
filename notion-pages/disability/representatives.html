          <h4><strong>Application Process:</strong></h4>
<p>During the application process, you can appoint a representative to help you:</p>
<ul><li>complete &amp; file forms</li><li>gather information and file it with us</li><li>review your file and understand the law</li><li>get information from us about your claim (including notices and letters)</li><li>represent you at hearings</li><li>give us evidence for you</li><li>help you with appeals</li></ul>
<p>To appoint someone as your representative, you must sign a statement using form <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/forms/ssa-1696.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SSA-1696</a>. Your representative does not have to be a lawyer, but he or she must have certain qualifications. Attorneys must be licensed and all others must have good character &amp; skills to help you. Your representative cannot be someone who is disqualified, suspended, or prohibited by law from acting as a representative.</p>
<p>If you do not have a representative and we denied your case, SSA will give you a list of legal referral services or community organizations in your area that can help you find a representative at no charge. The representative you appoint may not charge you a fee that is more than the amount authorized by SSA.</p>
<h4>Managing Benefits:</h4>
<p>Yes. A <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/ssi/text-repayee-ussi.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">representative payee</a> can manage your benefits for you if you are unable to do so. Your payee will receive your monthly benefits and must use the money to pay for your current needs, including: </p>
<ul><li>housing/utilities</li><li>food</li><li>medical/dental expenses</li><li>personal care items &amp; clothing</li><li>rehabilitation expenses</li></ul>
<p>After paying those expenses, your payee can use the rest of the money to do things like pay off debt, give you spending money, or save it for you. They must keep accurate records
of how they spend your money and report this information to Social Security, along with any changes in your eligibility.</p>
<p>Your representative payee can be a person, agency, organization, or institution. If Social Security receives information that indicates you need help in managing your money, they may select a representative payee for you, or you can request your own. </p>
<p><strong>The following people must have a representative payee:</strong></p>
<ul><li>children under 18*</li><li>legally incompetent adults</li><li>people who are incapable of managing or directing the management of his or her benefit</li></ul>
<p><strong>The following people are eligible to serve as a representative payee:</strong></p>
<ul><li>a parent, spouse, close relative, guardian, or friend who is concerned about your welfare</li><li>an institution (such as a nursing home)</li><li>a public or nonprofit agency, social service agency, or financial organization</li><li>providers or administrative officers at homeless shelters</li></ul>
<p>If you don’t agree that you need a payee or if you want a different payee, you can appeal within 60 days of social security&#39;s decision. </p>
<p>*If a child under age 18 is eligible for large past–due payments covering more than 6 months of benefits, the representative payee must put these payments directly into a separate <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/ssi/spotlights/spot-dedicated-accounts.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dedicated account</a> that will be monitored by SSA. These funds may only be used for certain disability or education-related expenses and not basic monthly maintenance costs. The account must:</p>
<ul><li>sbe separate from any other savings or checking account set up for the child</li><li>the title must show the child owns the funds (including interest)</li><li>not include other funds</li><li>not be in the form of certificates of deposit, mutual funds, stocks, bonds, or trusts.</li></ul>
<hr class="notion-divider" />
<p><strong>Advanced Designation:</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.ssa.gov/benefits/disability/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Advance Designation</a> allows capable beneficiaries to choose a representative payee in advance. In the event that you can no longer make your own decisions, SSA will first consider your advance designees. (They will still fully evaluate them and determine their suitability at that time.) You can submit your advance designation request on your benefits application or online using your mySocialSecurity account, by telephone, or in person. </p>
