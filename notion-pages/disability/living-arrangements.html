          <p>Your living arrangement is one of the factors used to determine how much money you can receive from SSI. Your payment may be reduced by one-third if you are not paying for food/shelter. <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/ssi/spotlights/spot-one-third-reduction.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">See example calculations here.</a></p>
<p>Your benefits may be reduced if:</p>
<ul><li>you live with another person and pay less than your &quot;fair share&quot; of food/housing costs</li><li>you live in your own house, apartment, or mobile home, but someone else pays for your food, rent, mortgage, or other expenses (like electricity or fuel)</li><li>you are in a hospital, treatment center, nursing home, or other facility for an entire month and Medicaid pays at least half the cost. </li></ul>
<hr class="notion-divider" />
<p>If you are homeless, you can receive up to the maximum SSI benefit while living in a public shelter for 6 months out of a 9 month period. You do not need an address to receive SSI. You can receive your benefits via:</p>
<ul><li>direct deposit</li><li>check mailed to someone else</li><li>representative payee</li><li>Direct Express debit bank card</li></ul>
<hr class="notion-divider" />
<p>If you live in an institution (such as a hospital, nursing home, prison, jail, etc.) you may not be eligible for SSI or may only be eligible for a maximum of $30/month. (Some states supplement the $30 benefit.)</p>
<p>If you are in a medical facility for 90 days or less, you may qualify to receive <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/ssi/spotlights/spot-temp-institution.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">temporary institutionalization benefits</a> if someone close to you (your representative payee or friend/family member) reports to SSA via telephone or in-person that you entered a medical facility and will be there for 90 days or less and that you need to continue your SSI benefits in order to maintain your living arrangement so that you can return upon discharge.</p>
<p>You will also need a signed statement from your physician indicating that they expect your medical confinement to last less than 90 full consecutive days (beginning with the day after you entered the institution). These statements must be sent to SSA before your discharge date or by the 90th day. </p>
<p>If you are not eligible for temporary institutionalization benefits, you may be eligible for <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/ssi/spotlights/spot-prerelease.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prerelease procedure</a>, which allows you to apply for benefits several months before your anticipated release from an institution. In a prerelease agreement, </p>
<p><em>your institution must agree to:</em></p>
<ul><li>notify SSA if you are likely to meet the criteria for benefits and you could be released within 30 days after notification of a decision</li><li>provide SSA with current medical evidence &amp;  other information needed to process your claim</li><li>provide SSA with your anticipated release date and notify them of any delays</li><li>notify SSA of your release</li></ul>
<p><em>social security agrees to:</em></p>
<ul><li>process your claim or reinstatement as quickly as possible</li><li>notify the institution of your SSI determination (if you give permission) </li></ul>
